=head1 NQP - Not Quite Perl (6)

This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a compiler for quickly generating PIR
routines from Perl6-like code.  The key feature of NQP is that it's
designed to be a very small compiler (as compared with, say, perl6
or Rakudo) and is focused on being a high-level way to create
transformers for Parrot (especially hll compilers).  In addition,
unlike Rakudo, NQP attempts to restrict itself to generating code
that can run in Parrot without the existence of any NQP-specific
runtime libraries.
