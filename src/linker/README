Hi! This is still a work in progress, so be aware that here there be bugs.

If any changes are made to main.c, run the following in this folder:
	make clean; make elfmaker

If you want to compile a program that uses modules, run the following from your perl6 root directory:
	perl6 -I./lib --compile=test ./test2.p6;
	perl6 -I./lib --bm=<files_from_./lib/.precomp> --compile=test ./test2.p6

If you want to compile a program that does not use modules, run the following from your perl6 root directory:
	perl6 --compile=foo foo.pl6

If you want to run your generated executable, run the following:
	./foo

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Currently, to compile, you do need to run the command from the root of your perl6 directory.

- At the moment, when the executable runs, it will successfully execute all of the code, and will then produce an error that says "Error while reading from file: Cannot find method 'slurp' on object of type NQPMu". This error does not mean that your code did not fully execute.

- Right now, only programs that use <= 1 module are supported by this.
